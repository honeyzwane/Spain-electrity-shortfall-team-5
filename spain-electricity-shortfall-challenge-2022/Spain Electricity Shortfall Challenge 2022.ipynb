    "*Electricity shortfalls are a new problem that many countries face. this issue goes on to affect the very economy of these countries. from the smallest business to the large ecomomy driving forces of a country. In todays world. the importance of electricity cannot be overstated. Almost all of the best innovation run on one form or another of electricity. \n",
    "Spain in light of its recent troubles with electricity shortfalls, has sought to diverge more into the renewable power sources. with this in mind, we have been tasked In this project to model the shortfall between the energy generated by means of fossil fuels and various renewable sources - for the country of Spain. The daily shortfall, which will be referred to as the target variable, will be modelled as a function of various city-specific weather features such as pressure,  wind speed, humidity, etc.*\n",
